Alfred is a Slack App to help organize the various projects in your organization.

Each project in Alfred's Bat Computer consists of a set of links, users, and channels grouped into sections.

There are two main use cases for Alfred.

1. What's the current link to that design/spec/environment/etc... for the project I'm working on?

2. Who should I talk to about/where would I ask about/what is that other project I don't work on?

There are plenty of other scenarios in which Alfred will be useful, but these are the main problems he's trying to solve.

The Bat Computer's projects are like a wiki. Anyone should feel free to add to/update anything in them. In face, Alfred relies on this. The service is only useful if the data in it is kept up to date (_please_ update it).
